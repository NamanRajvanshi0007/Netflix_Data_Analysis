# Netflix_Data_Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of Netflix movies to find trends and patterns. After cleaning the data, I created visualizations to explore popular genres, release years, and commonly used languages. The goal was to better understand Netflixâ€™s movie content through simple and clear data analysis.
